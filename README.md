# Simplified x86 Emulator (sx86)

Emulator for the simplified 16-bit x86 (sx86) ISA used in EC327 at [Boston University](http://www.bu.edu).

# Instructions 

# TODO

* Rewrite Javascript UI code to utilize JQuery.
* Check interface compatibility.
* Verify, fix and continue to develop processor code. Look into saving previous 
  states and reversability.
* Add "experimental" memory mapped IO interfaces, examples include: an LED 
  display; a SVG based drawing display (acts as a "coprocessor" which takes
  commands for drawing lines)
* Investigate changing name of ISA.
